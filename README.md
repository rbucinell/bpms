### For managing teams in line on a beer pong table at a party.

A small application I created in college circa the beginning of my first co-op to learn how to use Windows Forms. I have sporadically updated it here and there since then adding new features. 

#### Why Create this?
An issue my fraternity ran into while hosting parties is that guests would use their ID's or keys to reserve their space in line. This lead to the following issues:

1. If the marker was keys, we would have to run around the party asking who the keys belonged to. 
1. The lines were long, and would take up the length of the table getting in the way.
1. Markers would fall off the table, or someone would rearrange the order to move up in the line. Some teams were perpetually pushed to the end if they weren't watching.
1. Some people forgot to pick up their keys/ID's at the end of the night. Begging the question on how they got home, and inevitably needing them to come back the next day.

#### Features
1. Create a team, with optional team name. Making it easier to see who is playing, and who is on deck. The team names help with identifying teams when players are on multiple teams or have common names, as well as entertainment value.
1. Tracking stats of teams, including their longest streak and win loss ratio.
1. Displaying a line, to show who is coming up soon.
1. Table options like allowing teams to queue up multiple times and modifying the line as needed.
1. Password protecting options and line to preventing unauthorized users from modifying the line.
1. Multiple instances can be ran for multiple tables. Application can be themed to help determine which app is for which table.

>This project was originally created when I had little clue on many things. Its a fun project to go back to and slowly improve over time. Regrettably it was before I used version control properly, so it was tricky finding the right source code in all of my backups, and aside from a few old binaries, the v1.8 is the only version I have.
